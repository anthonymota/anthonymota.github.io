      <h2>pdf's</h2>
      <p>for the past week ive been trying to automate a program to fill out pdf's for my mom's business. although i still havent found a solution, i have learned alot about pdf's. so far i have learned that their internal structure is chaotic and that there are 2 basic pdf formats: acroform's and xfa's. the error message i keep getting is: "cannot read input pdf because it is not an acroform". maybe i could find out how to input data into the structure and then import it using a pdf viewer. well see</p>

      <p>other projects im working on are btre real estate website using the django framework and this blog. The next projects that i have in mind are: javascript30 course, full stack website course on udemy. i'm going to integrate the full stack website with this blog and have some fun with it.</p>

      <p>bills i have to pay today: carecredit(250), installment loan(300), wellsfargo(100) ticket(350), plus i have to do traffic school</p>
